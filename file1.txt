steps for cooking
=====================================
----------for the steak--------------
1.Prepare the Steak:
    Take the boneless steaks out of the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes before cooking.
    This allows for even cooking.
2.Season the Steak:
    Season both sides of each steak generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. 
    You can also sprinkle some fresh rosemary leaves on each side for flavor.
3.Preheat the Pan:
    Heat a heavy skillet (cast iron works well) or a grill pan over medium-high heat. 
    Add a small amount of olive oil or butter to prevent sticking.
4.Cook the Steak:
    Place the steaks in the hot pan and sear them for about 3-5 minutes on each side, 
    depending on your desired level of doneness (medium-rare, medium, etc.). 
    Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature (around 130°F or 54°C for medium-rare).
5.Rest the Steak:

    This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the steak juicy.

    Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until they're fork-tender, usually around 15-20 minutes.
3.Drain and Mash:
    Drain the cooked potatoes and return them to the pot. Mash them using a potato masher or a ricer. 
    For creamier potatoes, add warm milk and butter as you mash. Season with salt and white pepper (and optional minced garlic, Parmesan cheese, or sour cream) to taste.
