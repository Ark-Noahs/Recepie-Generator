=====================================
----------Sushi Rice-----------------
1 cup sushi rice
1 1/4 cups water
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

---------California Roll-------------
2 sheets of nori (seaweed)
1/2 avocado, thinly sliced
1/2 cucumber, thinly sliced into long strips
1/4 pound (about 4-5 pieces) imitation crab sticks (or real crab if preferred)
Soy sauce, for dipping
Pickled ginger, for serving
Wasabi, for serving
Sesame seeds (optional), for garnish
Bamboo sushi rolling mat (makisu)

Lets start Cooking!
=====================================
1. Prepare the Sushi Rice:
    -Rinse the sushi rice in a fine-mesh strainer until the water runs clear.
    -In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice and 1 1/4 cups of water. Bring it to a boil.
    -Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.
    -In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Heat it over low heat until the sugar and salt dissolve.
    -Transfer the cooked rice to a large bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Gently fold the vinegar mixture into the rice to season it. Let the rice cool to room temperature.
2. Prepare the Ingredients:
    -Slice the avocado and cucumber into thin strips.
    -If using imitation crab sticks, shred them into thin pieces.
3. Assemble the California Roll:
    -Place a bamboo sushi rolling mat on a clean, flat surface.
    -Lay a sheet of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat to prevent the rice from sticking.
    -Place a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap.
    -Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking, and then grab a handful of sushi rice (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup). Spread the rice evenly over the nori, leaving about 1 inch of nori on the top edge uncovered.
    -Sprinkle sesame seeds over the rice if desired.
    -Flip the nori sheet so that the rice is facing down on the plastic wrap and the uncovered nori edge is at the bottom.
    -Arrange the avocado, cucumber, and crab sticks horizontally in the center of the nori sheet.
4. Roll the Sushi:
    -Using the bamboo mat, start rolling the sushi tightly from the bottom, using even pressure. Roll it up and over the filling.
    -Moisten the uncovered nori edge with a bit of water to seal the roll.
    -Continue rolling until the entire sheet of nori is wrapped around the fillings.
    -Use the bamboo mat to shape the roll into a neat cylinder.
5. Slice and Serve:
    -Using a sharp knife dipped in water, slice the roll into bite-sized pieces. Clean the knife between cuts to keep the slices neat.
    -Arrange the California Roll slices on a plate.
    -Serve with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi.
